# PPScan
PPScan is a python written port scanner that can scan single and ranged IP Addresses using multi-threading algorithms. I was really boredðŸ¥± when i decided to write the program. 
# Usage
Use as you like, i don't really care. Just don't scan when you aren't given permission. I am not responsible for any damages caused by this program.
